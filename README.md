# Description
**This mod allows you to throw your axes.**

When you are **not** in attack cooldown, you can **press and hold** the **use** button to **charge**, and **release** it to **throw**.

The **longer** you charge, the **faster** it goes, and deals **60%~150%** of the axe's damage.

Throwing consumes **1 durability**. Axes can exist on objects for **2 minutes** before naturally discarding.

# Attribute
**A new attribute is added for one of the enchantments.**

### Vulnerability
This attribute **increases** the **damage** taken by an entity.

# Enchantments
**This mod adds 4 new enchantments to enhance the throw.**

### Bonding (Max Level I)
You can see the **outline** of the axe within **40 blocks**, and your movement speed is **increased** by **15%** when you are moving **towards** it.

If you are **no longer** moving towards it, the speed boost will gradually **decay** over **1 second**.

***

### Impact (Max Level IV)
After hitting an entity with a **thrown** axe, the entity will suffer from **6/9/12/15%** **slowness** and **12/16/20/24% vulnerability** for **8 seconds**.

If the axe didn't hit any entities, entities within **8** blocks from the axe will suffer from **half** of the normal slowness for **4** seconds when the axe hits an object.

***

### Well Prepared (Max Level V)
The axe gains **2/3/4/5/6 tokens**. Every time you throw your axe, a **token** will be **consumed** and you will **not** lose your axe.

After **picking up** an axe thrown by this enchantment, the corresponding axe **recovers** a token.

***

### Mastery (Max Level III)
The charging speed **increases** by **8/14/20%**. You can start charging when your **attack cooldown** reaches **80/65/50%**. The **slowness** applied while charging is **reduced** by **20/35/50%**.

You can only throw axes, sorry, I only feel like doing throwable axes for now. Or maybe swords on a good day, we'll see.
